# Christian Git

[![](https://api.codeclimate.com/v1/badges/410bbdeecc970066ba71/maintainability)](https://codeclimate.com/github/alexmacarthur/christian-git/maintainability)

A collection of Christianized aliases to sanctify your Git workflow.

## What is this?

Install this package and you'll have a collection of Christian-ese git aliases at your fingetips. You can use this package to completely replace your need to call `git` on your machine. If a Christian alias doesn't exist, it'll fall back to use the default command provided by Git.

For example, `Jesus testimony` calls `git log`.

| Command         | Alias       | Explanation
| ------------- |---------------|--------
| add           | annoint      | Your code's been annointed by God to be saved.
| blame | judas | Truly I tell you, one of you will betray me.
| branch | vine | He is the vine, we are the branches.
| checkout | resurrect | Resurrect what was once alive.
| clone | breadandfish | Jesus fed the 5000 with five loaves and two fish.
| commit | save      | Commit your code to the Lord and it will be saved.
| init | inthebeginning | Start us off, God.
| log | testimony | Use your code's testimony to share the path the Lord has led you along.
| merge | trinity | Father, Son, and Holy Spirit. Three in One.
| pull | petition | Petition the Lord through prayer to grant you those remote code changes.
| push | preach | Proudly declare your Gospel code to those who need it.
| rebase | disciple | Regularly examine your code, words and actions and compare them with the Word of God.
| reset | ark | God hit reset on the earth.
| status        | walk | How's your code's walk with the Lord?
