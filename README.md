# Christian Git

[![](https://api.codeclimate.com/v1/badges/410bbdeecc970066ba71/maintainability)](https://codeclimate.com/github/alexmacarthur/christian-git/maintainability)

A collection of Christianized aliases to sanctify your Git workflow.

## What is this?

Install this package and you'll have a collection of Christian Git aliases at your fingertips, all provided by the `christian-git` command. You can use this package to completely replace your need to call `git` on your machine. If a Christian alias doesn't exist, it'll fall back to use the default command provided by Git.

For example, `christian-git testimony` calls `git log`.
